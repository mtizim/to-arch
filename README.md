# Manjaro to Arch conversion script
## Stay away if you use LUKS!
<!--![](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/sugkiy/manjarotoarch/total)<br>-->
This is a script to convert a Manjaro installation to an Arch installation with a single command for users who want a fuss-free conversion from Manjaro to Arch because of the old ABIs in the stable branch that don't match up with the AUR or ArchISO doesn't want to add a boot entry or the unstable branch doens't have servers near them.<br>This script is inspired by [this gist](https://gist.github.com/mariuszkurek/bff8a821076f5406b15fe9be528957b6/) which _did_ work but wasn't _seamless_.<br>
Run this on the same directory as where `to_arch` exists.
```shell
chmod 777 to_arch
./to_arch
```

## Why did I write this?

A few months ago, I was using Manjaro just because I liked the green theme, and I just wanted to compile [paru](https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru).<br> The `libalpm` library and `pacman`, which recently had a major update at the time, weren't updated in Manjaro's mirrors, but `paru` already had an implementation of the updated versions.<br>I did manage to compile it by switching to an old tag, but it was very inconvenient, and I decided to switch to Arch while preserving my userspace. Online guides of it were wrong in many ways, and I finally found a working _script_ which _did_ work, but was incomplete. I decided to improve it, and the result is this.
#### Also I wanted to help people who aren't skilled enough to install Arch, but wants to say `btw i use arch`.

## How this script works

The main difference of pure Arch and Manjaro is that they use different mirrors. Manjaro uses slightly old versions of a package for testing, so changing it to Arch mirrors is the first step.<br>Then the script deletes Manjaro-specific packages and Pacman configurations, and enables the multilib repository if it's commented out.<br>After that, the script performs a `pacman -Syyuu` so that the packages are updated and installs an Arch kernel.<br>Finally GRUB is updated to have Arch's theme and the distributor name is changed to `Arch` by installing `lsb-release` from the Arch Linux website.<br>Finally DE-specific operations are performed to give a better polished result.

## TODO

- [x] Check if UEFI or legacy BIOS

- [x] Choose a different editor other than ${EDITOR}

- [x] Ask reboot after run

- [x] Ask which kernel version is to be installed

- [x] Manjaro Sway community edition support
